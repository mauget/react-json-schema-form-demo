# Example of React JSON Schema Form with Styled Components

## Description
This web application displays a styled from based on a JSON
document, a JSON schema describing the document, and a JSON
UI schema that says how to render the form items of the document.

It uses a custom object field template in its Ui schema to force
fields into two columns or one column for narrow views.
